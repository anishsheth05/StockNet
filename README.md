# StockNet
A novice attempt at using machine learning to predict the stock market.

Neural Network Basics is not my work: it is that of YouTuber Sentdex's Neural Networks from Scratch series, in which he explains the concepts and implementation for a basic neural network. Neuralizer 3000 is an implementation of such a network to attempt predicting stocks based on previous data. For it to work, you must first run StockDataGetter to acquire the data, ensuring required dependencies are present. Then, run StockDataParser to process that data for use in the neural network.
